# WorkShops

Workshop sessions is one of the core parts of the "Practicing TDD" course. This kind of sessions is implemented in specific way:

Group of people sit in a room with PC and projector. Two men from group peek a task from provided list and implement it in _live_ mode using ping-pong technique. Rest of group observes this process and corrects their actions if they choose a wrong path, or avoiding TDD practicies.

Pairs of programmers switch from task to task.

All workshops sessions tasks are listed below in corresponding order

## FizzBuzz

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100. But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “FizzBuzz “.

### Bob

Bob is a lackadaisical teenager. In conversation, his responses are very limited.

Bob answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question. (? in the end)

He answers 'Whoa, chill out!' if you yell at him. (! in the end)

He says 'Fine. Be that way!' if you address him without actually saying anything.

He answers 'Whatever.' to anything else.

Implement Bob!

### Anagram

Given a word and a list of possible anagrams, select the correct sublist.

Given "listen" and a list of candidates like "enlists" "google" "inlets" "banana" the program should return a list containing "inlets".

### Allergies

Given a person's allergy score, determine whether or not they're allergic to a given item, and their full list of allergies.
An allergy test produces a single numeric score which contains the information about all the allergies the person has (that they were tested for).
The list of items (and their value) that were tested are:
    eggs (1)
    peanuts (2)
    shellfish (4)
    strawberries (8)
    tomatoes (16)
    chocolate (32)
    pollen (64)
    cats (128)
So if Tom is allergic to peanuts and chocolate, he gets a score of 34.

Now, given just that score of 34, your program should be able:
1. To say have Tom allergic to specific product or not.
2. To give list of all allergens Tom is allergic to.

Note: a given score may include allergens not listed above (i.e. allergens that score 256, 512, 1024, etc.). Your program should ignore those components of the score. For example, if the allergy score is 257, your program should only report the eggs (1) allergy.

## Functionality decomposition training:

### Roman numerals

Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals.

The Romans wrote numbers using letters - I, V, X, L, C, D, M. (converter http://www.novaroma.org/via_romana/numbers.html)

There is no need to be able to convert numbers larger than about 3000. (The Romans themselves didn't tend to go any higher)

Wikipedia says: Modern Roman numerals ... are written by expressing each digit separately starting with the left most digit and skipping any digit with a value of zero.

To see this in practice, consider the example of 1990.
In Roman numerals 1990 is MCMXC:
1000=M 900=CM 90=XC

2008 is written as MMVIII:
2000=MM 8=VIII

1998 is written as MCMXCVIII.

## Mocking & Faking training

### Timer

Implement a timer class that implements a following interface:
```
typedef std::chrono::high_resolution_clock Clock;
typedef Clock::duration Duration;
typedef std::chrono::time_point<Clock> TimePoint;

class ITimer {
public:
  virtual ~ITimer() {}

  virtual void Start() = 0;
  virtual bool IsExpired() const = 0;
  virtual Duration TimeLeft() const = 0;
};
```

Followed by this specification:
* Timer allows to determine if specific period of time expired or not since Start was called last time
* Timer allows to determine how much time left till period is expired
* Timer can be started again any time, no metter in what state it is

### Coffee
We have several coffee machines. We have to create class which makes a coffee.
```
class ICoffeCore
{
public:
    ~ICoffeCore(){}
    virtual void SetCupSize(int gram) = 0;
    virtual void AddWater(int gram, int temperature) = 0;
    virtual void AddSugar(int gram) = 0;
    virtual void AddCoffee(int gram) = 0;
    virtual void AddMilk(int gram) = 0;
    virtual void AddMilkFoam(int gram) = 0;
    virtual void AddChocolate(int gram) = 0;
    virtual void AddCream(int gram) = 0;
};
```

We produce:
(sequence)
- americano: water & coffee 1:2 or 1:3. Water temp 60C
- cappuccino - milk & coffee & milk foam 1:3, 1:3, 1:3. Water temp 80C
- latte - milk & coffee & milk foam 1:4, 1:2, 1:4. Water temp 90C
- marochino - chocolate & coffee & milk foam, 1:4, 1:4, 1:4 and 1:4 is empty

We have 2 size of cup, it is:
- little 100 gram
- big 140 gram
